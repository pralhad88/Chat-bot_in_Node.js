      "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - Sudden and unexpected problems could have your household in chaos, Aries. This probably doesn't relate to difficulties with your housemates. It's more likely to involve problems with wiring, appliances, or phone lines. It could be annoying to deal with repairmen in and out of your house, but you will have to bear with it. You want your household back to normal as soon as possible.",

      "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - Too many communications may prove distracting today, Taurus. The phone could be ringing off the hook and your email inbox overflowing. Everyone around you seems to be talking at once. If you don't bring some order to this chaos, it could give you a headache! Let voicemail get the phone, get away from the computer, and take something light to the park to read. You need some peace and quiet.",

Maybe someone needs an unexpected trip to the dentist. This could throw you off balance, but you can manage it by cutting some corners. So what if you have to eat pasta for a week or two? It could be worse! Just move ahead with whatever needs to be done.",

No major concerns should arise, but little irritations like dropping things, misplacing keys, or missing calls could get on your nerves. Slow down and stay focused. It's the only way you will remain calm today.",

You may have glossed over some of the ideas that are prerequisites to what you're looking at now. Go back and review last week's lesson and everything might make more sense to you. You will probably progress that much faster for doing this.",

But it could be a while before your friend is solvent again. If you make the loan, remember the adage about never lending anything to a friend that you aren't willing to consider a gift. Don't depend on immediate repayment.",

Don't try to fix it yourself even if you think you know how. Call a professional, and hang the expense. If you try to do it yourself, you might cause more damage to the equipment or perhaps to you! This is definitely a day to exercise caution. Be patient!",

That's the only way you can stay sane!",

Someone has misinterpreted a piece of information and blown it into something far different from reality. You will need to check this out for yourself before jumping to any conclusions.

Someone else may have been meant to go but couldn't, so you may be taking his or her place. This could be disruptive for you, but if you make an effort, you can turn it into an adventure. It's always best to go with the flow and make the most of it.",

All signs are that your friend has received some bad news and didn't want to upset you. Hang in there. You should hear from your honey again soon.",

Your mind may not be quite as quick as it usually is, and you may go through the day in a bit of a fog, possibly reflecting on the past. This isn't quite as aimless as it sounds.

So, while you may get busy trying your luck at risky speculative markets, Ganesha may get increasingly worried about the losses you may incur because of your foolishness. It's better that you do nothing and spend some time with your family, make some changes in your house, or do anything to keep yourself busy. Even if you are feeling lucky, just don't try your luck, says Ganesha.",

You will promptly get back to pursuing your goals and your reputation with seniors will play a crucial role in bagging you tangible rewards.",

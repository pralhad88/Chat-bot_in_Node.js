[{"Sign": "Aries", "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - Sudden and unexpected problems could have your household in chaos, Aries. This probably doesn't relate to difficulties with your housemates. It's more likely to involve problems with wiring, appliances, or phone lines. It could be annoying to deal with repairmen in and out of your house, but you will have to bear with it. You want your household back to normal as soon as possible.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2019", "id": 1}, {"Sign": "Tauras", "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - Too many communications may prove distracting today, Taurus. The phone could be ringing off the hook and your email inbox overflowing. Everyone around you seems to be talking at once. If you don't bring some order to this chaos, it could give you a headache! Let voicemail get the phone, get away from the computer, and take something light to the park to read. You need some peace and quiet.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2019", "id": 2}, {"Sign": "Gemini", "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - A sudden but necessary expense could make a big hole in your budget today, Gemini. Perhaps some repairs need to be made around the house or to the car. Maybe someone needs an unexpected trip to the dentist. This could throw you off balance, but you can manage it by cutting some corners. So what if you have to eat pasta for a week or two? It could be worse! Just move ahead with whatever needs to be done.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2019", "id": 3}, {"Sign": "Cancer", "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - Generally you're pretty emotionally stable, Cancer. Today's events might seem to conspire to create erratic moods that you aren't used to feeling. No major concerns should arise, but little irritations like dropping things, misplacing keys, or missing calls could get on your nerves. Slow down and stay focused. It's the only way you will remain calm today.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2019", "id": 4}, {"Sign": "Leo", "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - If you've been studying astrology, numerology, or any other occult science, Leo, today you might find some of the concepts you're studying a bit confusing. You may have glossed over some of the ideas that are prerequisites to what you're looking at now. Go back and review last week's lesson and everything might make more sense to you. You will probably progress that much faster for doing this.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2019", "id": 5}, {"Sign": "Virgo", "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - A friend could be having financial troubles and ask you for a loan, Virgo. You like this person and understand what he or she's going through, so you want to help. But it could be a while before your friend is solvent again. If you make the loan, remember the adage about never lending anything to a friend that you aren't willing to consider a gift. Don't depend on immediate repayment.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2019", "id": 6}, {"Sign": "Libra", "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - Some equipment that you use a lot, perhaps an appliance, computer, or TV, might go on the blink today, Libra. Don't try to fix it yourself even if you think you know how. Call a professional, and hang the expense. If you try to do it yourself, you might cause more damage to the equipment or perhaps to you! This is definitely a day to exercise caution. Be patient!", "Date": "Mar 11, 2019", "id": 7}, {"Sign": "Scorpio", "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - Some rather bizarre news could come to you today about metaphysical or paranormal matters, Scorpio. This isn't anything that affects you directly, but more likely concerns discoveries of anomalies. You and others could find it fascinating and discuss it for hours. Don't be surprised if the theories that come up seem even more bizarre than what you heard in the first place!", "Date": "Mar 11, 2019", "id": 8}, {"Sign": "Sagittarius", "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - This could be a hectic day, Sagittarius. You will probably try to go too many places and do too many things at once. Friends might want to get together, but you may have a lot of errands to take care of. It might be a good idea to assess what needs to be done and take care of it in order of urgency. That's the only way you can stay sane!", "Date": "Mar 11, 2019", "id": 9}, {"Sign": "Capricorn", "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - You might hear some rather bizarre rumors today, Capricorn. Someone has misinterpreted a piece of information and blown it into something far different from reality. You will need to check this out for yourself before jumping to any conclusions. Don't be afraid to pass on what you learn. It's better to nip this sort of gossip in the bud by revealing the facts than let it continue to spread.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2019", "id": 10}, {"Sign": "Aquarius", "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - Today you might plan a quick trip by air, Aquarius. This could be business related. Someone else may have been meant to go but couldn't, so you may be taking his or her place. This could be disruptive for you, but if you make an effort, you can turn it into an adventure. It's always best to go with the flow and make the most of it.", "Date": "Mar 11, 2019", "id": 11}, {"Sign": "Pisces", "Prediction": "Mar 11, 2019 - A date to get together with a romantic partner might have to be broken at the last minute, Pisces.
